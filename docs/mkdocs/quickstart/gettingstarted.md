# Getting Started with Terracatalog

In order to start using *terracatalog* to deploy an AWS toolkit for explore public dasets using analytics services, users will need:

- ☁️ [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) available for use
- 🔑 [Programatic access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) on the account with an `access_key_id` and a `secret_access_key`
- ⛏ [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed (version >=1.0)

???+ tip "Two ways for using terracatalog"
    In fact, there are two ways for using *terracatalog* and all its features:
    
    1. By calling it from another Terraform project (prefered one)
    2. By cloning the source repo and deploying infrastructure by running the Terraform commands

    In this section users will take the chance to precisely look at both usage modes in order to select the one that best suits their needs.
