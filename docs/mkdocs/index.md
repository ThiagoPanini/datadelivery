# datadelivery: Helping users to start their analytics journey at AWS

## Overview

The *datadelivery* project is an open source solution that provides a starter toolkit to be deployed in any AWS account in order to enable users to begin their learning path on AWS analytics services, like Athena, Glue, EMR, Redshift. It does that by supplying a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) module that can be called from any Terraform project for deploying all the infrastructure needed to take the first steps using analytics in AWS with public datasets to be explored.

- Have you ever wanted to have a bunch of datasets to explore in AWS?
- Have you ever wanted to take public data and start building an ETL process?
- Have you ever wanted to go deep into the Data Mesh architecture with SoR, SoT and Spec layers?

ðŸš› Try *datadelivery*!

## Features

- ðŸš€ A pocket and disposable AWS environment
- ðŸª£ Automatic creation of S3 buckets using the SoR, SoT and Spec storage layers approach
- ðŸ¤– Automatic data cataloging process using a scheduled Glue Crawler
- ðŸŽ² Provides different dataset tables ready to be explored in any AWS analytics service
- ðŸ”¦ Destroy everything and recreate all again at a touch of a single command

## How it Works?

When users call the *datadelivery* Terraform module, the following operations are performed:

1. Five different buckets are created in the target AWS account
2. The content of `data/` folder at the source module are uploaded to the SoR bucket
3. An IAM role is created with enough permissions to run a Glue Crawler
4. A Glue Crawler is created with a S3 target pointing to the SoR bucket
5. A cron expression is configured to trigger the Glue Crawler 2 minutes after finishing the infrastructure deployment
6. All files from SoR bucket (previously on `data/` folder) are cataloged as new tables on Data Catalog
7. A preconfigured Athena workgroup is created in order to enable users to run queries
